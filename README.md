## FRC Robots CAPTCHA

_A CAPTCHA to test your FRC nerdiness._

The CAPTCHA provides an image of a FRC robot as a challenge. As a robot's team number is visible on its bumper, the CAPTCHA uses the robot's team number as a response. For example:

![2485](http://www.idleloop.com/frctracker/photoshare/robot_photos/2013/4131.jpg)

could be the challenge and `2485` would be the correct response.

Implemented on Team 2485's website at [http://robotics.francisparker.org/contact](http://robotics.francisparker.org/contact).
